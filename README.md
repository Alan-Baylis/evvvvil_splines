Bézier Spline Drawing tool for UNITY 3D

A bézier spline path drawing tool for UNITY 3D based on Adobe Illustrator's bézier drawing tool but with a bit more attitude.
You can draw bézier in 3d space continuously while switching orthographic views, also works in non-orthographic views.

The drawn Bézier paths can be used as camera paths or "align to path" splines with any 3d object. Also 3d objects can be spread along the spline.

TO DO: 
Bézier paths to also be actual geometry, use obscure extrude geometry shader arbitrary perpendicular plane calculation or something with Y up.
